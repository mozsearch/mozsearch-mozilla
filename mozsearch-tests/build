## Attempt to just reuse the `make build-test-repo` target
#
# Our high level goal is to produce output that looks identical to what happens
# when someone does `cd /vagrant; make build-test-repo` in a docker VM.  And we
# want to do this without forking the relevant build script.

# The tests config.json file is here:
TESTS_ROOT=$INDEX_ROOT/git/tests
# The "build" script is in the "tests" dir under that:
TESTS_CONFIG_DIR=$TESTS_ROOT/tests

# just transfer control into the build script
exec $TESTS_CONFIG_DIR/build
