# Build a pyrightconfig.json config (config docs are at
# https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration).
#
# In general it seems like we can get a list of all of the python path entries
# possible from processing the files in
# https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/sites and where the
# ingestion logic that consumes those files seems to be
# https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/da49863c3d6f34038d00f5ba701b9a2ad9cbadba/python/mach/mach/requirements.py#88-149
# and the relevant comment about its ingestion is
# https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/da49863c3d6f34038d00f5ba701b9a2ad9cbadba/python/mach/mach/requirements.py#31-54
# and so we use ripgrep below to extract out the "pth" and "vendored" directives
# that give us paths in trees.  We do not process "packages.txt" which is fine
# because it also doesn't seem to be used and it is arguably unlikely that it
# could ever contain paths relative to the root of m-c as we need.
#
# Because pyright seems to (quite fairly) get overwhelmed if we point it at a
# ton of things, we also filter out everything with "third_party" in the actual
# path.  We can't do this based on the basis of "vendored" because there are
# things like wptrunner that are vendored but which we deeply want indexed.
#
# We also filter out roots that potentially entrain a whole bunch of files,
# in particular "testing/web-platform" adds like 2000 python test files that
# seems to be what sets searchfox on fire.
#
# Specific settings:
# - verboseOutput: when true, this will print a lot of output about module
#   resolution failures and the paths it tried.  Unfortunately this does not
#   really help with understanding what is going on when the indexing process
#   just sits there and gobbles up CPU.
# - includes: We include every path we figure out from the sites .txt files.
# - extraPaths: We include them again here for path resolution purposes since
#   it seemed like the path resolution logic didn't consider what we provided to
#   "includes" for this purpose.
