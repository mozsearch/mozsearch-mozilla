# the starting point for the build logic here is from:
# https://github.com/dpino/webkit-index-config/blob/master/webkit/build
#
# our primary changes here are:
# - we handle the dependencies and flatpak updating in `setup` so that we can
#   persist the downloaded flatpak state in `upload` because the flatpak server
#   seems to only be able to talk to our AWS instances at very slow speeds like
#   600kB/s.  (It started faster and goes downhill from there.  We're talking
#   hours for a full download, though.)
# - we dump the indexer setup to "config" like other build scripts so we can
#   look at it afterwards rather than sourcing it directly.

# Add the special clang flags.

# Webkit does something weird where it ends up with duplicate copies of some
# header files in OBJDIR/WebCore/PrivateHeaders/.  It seems like they're
# installed there and both the original and the private headers end up with
# equivalent analysis records.  Based on extremely cursory investigation, only
# the source-tree file has actual include usages.  But since only the source
# tree has blame history and is permalink-able, it seems reasonable to nuke the
# private headers' analysis data to avoid them breaking "go to definition" and
# "go to declaration".
