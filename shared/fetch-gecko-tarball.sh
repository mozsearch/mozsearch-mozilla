# into the working dir if it hasn't already been downloaded,
# and then unpack it into the specified destination folder.
# This is a shared helper because we have multiple repos that
# download the same tarball which takes time/bandwidth; doing
# it once and reusing it saves about 3 minutes/7.5 Gb per
# additional repo that uses it.
