# On Windows, analysis for headers ends up in __GENERATED__/dist/include/...
# instead of the source version of the file. This happens because Windows doesn't
# support symlinks, and so during the build, headers are copied rather than
# symlinked into dist/include. When clang processes the source files, it therefore
# can't "dereference" the symlinks (because they're not symlinks) to find the
# original source file. This results in the misplaced analysis data. To handle
# this, we use the distinclude mapfile produced by the taskcluster job to
# squash the analysis data for such files back to the source file that it belongs
# with. The "squash" is just appending the analysis data from the dist/include
# version to the analysis data (if it exists) for the real source. The step
# to merge the analyses across platforms later in this script will deduplicate
# any redundant lines.
